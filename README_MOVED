Hi,

are you looking for the latest version of mirall? Good :-) 

My branch of Mirall has moved to gitorious.org because it moved 
a bit closer to the ownCloud project, which is completely hosted
on gitorious. That is why we decided to go there.

Please visit http://gitorious.org/owncloud/mirall
or see Duncans root repository at
https://github.com/dmacvicar/mirall

Thanks,

Klaas <freitag@owncloud.com>
